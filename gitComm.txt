blob= binary large objects
--[word] = flag
sha1= an object translated to a hash
git show -s --pretty=raw [commit hash]=m show you detailed information about the commitment
git ls-tree [tree hash] //Blob in the tree

- Undo comms:
git checkout [filename] //Undo specific file
git checkout . //Undo all the files in the folder
git clean -xdf //Delete files that are not in the repository, -x= ignore aplicable rules to the files, -d= remove 
	       //directories related, -f= force command 
git reset HEAD~n //n = ammount of commits that you want to go back in a commit
git reset //as the steps to push a commit is add-commit-push the reset comm help to undone an n amount of steps
	  //f.e.: --soft you go back one step (commit to add, push to commit), --mixed let you go the start, 
	  //--hard delete the latest changes and cannot undone this command 

git revert [first 5 commit hash's chars] -> write the commit message (optional) -> press ESC, type "wq" and press Enter
* if instead wq type q! then won't perform the revert 

The rebase comm can be used to set the changes in a branch keeping the time that the commits were done. 
The Golden Rule with rebasing is that you can only used it in minimum impact and your own branches, as it pushes 
the commits in its own chronological order and changes the files without keeping the changes made before them.

With Cherry-pick you can take one or more commits from a branch and place it in your actual one 

If you has made some changes in a branch and have to change to another one but dont want to lose those changes without
committing then you can use stash. Here are the commands to keep in mind:
- git stash save [description] //Save working directory
- git stash list //View stashes
To bring them back
- git stash pop [Stash name]//and remove from stash
- git stash apply [Stash name]//keep the stash
git stash drop [Stash name]//Remove the stash without using it 

To change the Github repository to sync with exist the remote comms:
- git remote add [branch name] [URL] //Add the repository to the path in the git
				     //project
- git remote remove [branch name]//Delete path
- git remote -v //Show all the available paths and their command to interact with
		//them
